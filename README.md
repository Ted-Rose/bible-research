# Bible Study Companion: A Modern Bible App Created for You

A working prototype (MVP) is available [here](https://reactive-bible-4n3yzn5f6-vincent-uches-projects.vercel.app/).

## Why another Bible app?

We've identified several features missing from existing Bible applications:

### Shareable Public Notes
**What is it?**
A platform where users can share their Bible notes or collections with specific verses and commentary.

**Why it matters:**
Enhances evangelism and mentoring by allowing users to share specific verses with others while providing access to complete chapters for context.

### Cross-Platform Access
**What is it?**
Seamless availability of notes across mobile and desktop devices.

**Why it matters:**
Many users prefer conducting in-depth Bible research on desktop platforms, a feature not universally supported by existing Bible apps.

### Exportable Notes
**What is it?**
Functionality to export all personal notes to external formats.

**Why it matters:**
Provides freedom and flexibility by allowing users to continue their Bible study using other tools (such as Excel or Word).

### Audio Loop Feature
**What is it?**
The ability to select specific verses and listen to them repeatedly.

**Why it matters:**
Useful for verse memorization (e.g. while driving a car).

### Advanced Search Capabilities
- Exclude specific keywords from search results
- Support for exact text matching, approximate matching, and semantic search (e.g., searching for "fire" would also return results containing "flame")

### Community Discussion Features
**What is it?**
Spaces for both public and private group discussions about scripture. Public notes are visible to everyone with commenting options, while private notes can be restricted to specific groups or individuals.

**Why it matters:**
- Centers conversations around scripture
- Allows users to easily access community commentary while reading the Bible
